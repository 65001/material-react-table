        Please add a link to a minimal reproduction. This can really speed up the diagnosis of the problem!
        Note:
          - Your bug may get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
          - To create a shareable code example for web, you can use CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new).
          - Please make sure the example is complete and runnable without prior dependencies and free of unnecessary abstractions
          - Feel free to fork any of the official CodeSandbox examples to reproduce your issue: https://github.com/KevinVandy/material-react-table/tree/main/material-react-table-docs/examples
          - Please read these tips for providing a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
