# Material React Table

> This Project is based on react-table v8, which itself is still in alpha, and therefore this package is also still in alpha

- A fully featured Material UI v5 implementation of react-table v8 (alpha)
- Inspired by material-table and the MUI X DataGrid
- Written from the ground up in TypeScript, Material UI, and React Table
- All internal Material UI components are easily customizable
