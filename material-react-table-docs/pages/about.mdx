## About Material React Table

A fully featured Material-UI V5 implementation of react-table, inspired by [material-table](https://material-table.com/) and the [MUI DataGrid](https://mui.com/components/data-grid/#mit-version), written from the ground up in TypeScript.

### Motivation

[`material-react-table`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-react-table) started out as an attempt to upgrade the popular [material-table](https://material-table.com/) library to Material-UI V5 and TypeScript, since that project seems to have become abandoned. However, after a few frustrating weeks, it was discovered that it would be easier and more fun to write a new advanced Material UI table library from scratch. [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) naturely seemed like a great basis for the underlying API, and so it was chosen as the foundation for the project.

### Project Goals

- Stick to material design principles
- Fully enable all features of the [react-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) API (as much as reasonable possible)
- Prefer performance and bundle size over over-the-top built-in features
- Enable full customization easily (CSS, layout, icons, localization, etc.)
