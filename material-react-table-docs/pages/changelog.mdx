## Changelog

### Pre 1.0.0 breaking changes

While MRT is pre-1.0, breaking changes are subject to occur. MRT should hit 1.0 by August 2022 and become stable.

TanStack Table 8.1 had some breaking changes that will be reflected here in MRT v0.19.0

- v0.33.0 - `onTableInstanceChange` removed, `onStateChange` removed, custom `filterFns` can be used again, renamed `ToolbarBottom` to `BottomToolbar` and `ToolbarTop` to `TopToolbar`
- v0.31.0 - new DropZone component in toolbar for grouping while dragging a column that can be grouped
- v0.29.0 - new `filterVariant` option on columnDef to indicate if filter is a select filter, multi-select filter, text filter, etc.
- v0.28.0 - `virtualizerProps` has slightly differently named options, as MRT upgraded to `@tanstack/react-virtual` `v3`.
- v0.27.0 - `enableColumnFilterChangeMode` is now false by default, but can be turned on easily by just setting it to true.
- v0.23.0 - TanStack Table v8.2 has new `cell.getValue<>()` generics
- v0.22.1 - `showFilters` state renamed to `showColumnFilters`
- v0.22.0 - React DnD replaced with custom solution for drag and drop. Now lib is 16kb smaller!
- V0.19.0 - Data Column Definitions now need an `accessorKey` or a combination of an `id` and `accessorFn` to be used as the key for the data row.
- V0.19.0 - `instance` was renamed to `table` across all callback functions to be inline with TanStack Table V8.1.
- V0.18.0 - on...Changed callback props were removed as they were redundant with the on...Change callback props. Hoisting state will be the recommended way to watch for table state changes and react to them.

## Roadmap

A beta release is slated to be released by August 2022, and a stable release should follow shortly thereafter.

Most development now remains in fully fleshing out the docs and solving edge cases. Filtering and Aggregation could still see a lot of improvements in the near future.
