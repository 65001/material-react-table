## Changelog

### Pre 1.0.0 breaking changes

While MRT is pre-1.0, breaking changes are subject to occur. MRT should hit 1.0 before August 2022 and become stable.

TanStack Table 8.1 had some breaking changes that will be reflected here in MRT v0.19.0

- V0.19.0 - Data Column Definitions now need an `accessorKey` or a combination of an `id` and `accessorFn` to be used as the key for the data row.
