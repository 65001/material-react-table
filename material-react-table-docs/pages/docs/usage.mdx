## Usage

In order to start using MaterialReactTable, you need to first [install](/docs/install) `material-react-table` and the necessary Material UI v5 dependencies.

There are additional steps and customizations you can do for Material UI, if you have not set it up in your application already. Check out the [Material UI docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) for more information.

Once you have everything installed, you can import `material-react-table` like this:

```jsx
import MaterialReactTable from 'material-react-table';
```

To get started creating a basic table, all you need to do is to provide the **columns** definitions and the table **data**.

```jsx
<MaterialReactTable
  columns={columns} //must be memoized
  data={data} //must be memoized
/>
```

> **Note:** It is very important that the columns and data definitions are _memoized_ or _stable_. Otherwise, the entire table will be re-rendered during every react re-render in your application, which can lead to performance issues.

Each column definition must have, at the very least, an `accessorKey` (or a combination of an `id` and `accessorFn`) and a `header` property. The `accessorKey`/`accessorFn` property is the key that will be used to join the data from the `data` keys. The `header` property is used to display the column header, but is also used in other places in the table. If you want to pass in custom JSX to render the header, you can pass in a `Header` property in addition to the `header` string property.

```jsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'name',
      header: 'Name',
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'age',
      header: 'Age', 
      Header: () => <i>Age</i>, //optional custom jsx
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

Your data is an array of objects that have properties matching the accessors in your column definitions.

```jsx
const data = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      name: 'John',
      age: 30,
    },
    {
      name: 'Sara',
      age: 25,
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

Throw it all together and you have a basic table!

```jsx
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import MaterialReactTable from 'material-react-table';

export default function App() {
  const columns = useMemo(
    () => [
      {
        accessorKey: 'name',
        header: 'Name',
      },
      {
        accessorKey: 'age',
        header: 'Age',
        Header: () => <i>Age</i>, //optional custom jsx
      },
    ],
    [],
  );

  const data = useMemo(
    () => [
      {
        name: 'John',
        age: 30,
      },
      {
        name: 'Sara',
        age: 25,
      },
    ],
    [],
  );

  return <MaterialReactTable columns={columns} data={data} />;
}
```

This is just the default table that you get. You may want to disable some features that you don't need, or enable and customize other features that you may want. See the [minimal example](/docs/examples/minimal) and [advanced example](/docs/examples/advanced) to get a better idea for how you may want to customize your table, and visit the [props page](/docs/api/props) to see all the props that you can use to turn features on and off, and customize the look and feel of your table.
