## Data Columns

Data Columns are the columns that are used to display data. They are the default columns that are created when you create a column with an `accessorKey` or `accessorFn`.

The table can perform processing on the data of a Data Column, such as sorting, filtering, grouping, etc.

The other type of column that you can make is a "Display Column", which you can learn more about in the [next section](/docs/guides/display-columns).

### Accessors (Connect a column to data)

Each column definition must have, at the very least, an `accessorKey` (or a combination of an `id` and `accessorFn`) and a `header` property. The `accessorKey`/`accessorFn` property is the key that will be used to join the data from the `data` keys. The `header` property is used to display the column header, but is also used in other places in the table.

#### Method 1 - Using an accessorKey (Recommended)

The simplest and most common way to define a column is to use the `accessorKey` property. It works great as long as your data is already in a flat format.

The `accessorKey` must match one of the keys in your data, or else no data will show up in the column.

By default, the `accessorKey` will double as the `id` for the column, but if you need the id of the column to be different than the accessorKey, you can use the `id` property in addition.

```jsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'name', //id will be derived from `accessorKey` unless otherwise specified (Recommended)
      header: 'Name',
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'customerAge',
      id: 'age' //id overridden, usually not necessary to do this, but can be helpful
      header: 'Age',
    },
  ] as MRT_ColumnDef<Customer>[], //TypeScript type here makes the auto-complete work really well!
  [],
);
```

#### Method 2 - Using an accessorFn and id

To access more complicated data structures, you can use the `accessorFn` property. Here are at least 3 ways you can use it.

In each case, the `id` property is now required since there is no `accessorKey` for MRT to derive it from.

```jsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      //simple accessorFn that works the same way as an `accessorKey`
      accessorFn: (row) => row.username,
      id: 'username',
      header: 'Username',
    },
    {
      //accessorFn function that combines multiple data together
      accessorFn: (row) => `${data.firstName} ${data.lastName}`,
      id: 'name',
      header: 'Name',
    },
    {
      //accessorFn used to access nested data
      accessorFn: (row) => data.personalInfo.age,
      id: 'age',
      header: 'Age',
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

#### Custom Header JSX Render

If you want to pass in custom JSX to render the header, you can pass in a `Header` property in addition to the `header` string property.

```jsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'name',
      header: 'Name',
      Header: ({ header }) => (
        <i style={{ color: 'red' }}>{header.column.columnDef.header}</i>
      ), //arrow function
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'age',
      header: 'Age',
      Header: <i style={{ color: 'red' }}>Age</i>, //plain jsx with no function
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```
