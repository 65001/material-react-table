## Density Toggle Feature Guide

### Relevant Props

- enableDensityToggle

### Relevant State

- density

---

By default, Material React Table will render with a medium `comfortable` density.

A density toggle is shown by default to let a user change the density to cycle through `spacious`, `comfortable`, and `compact` densities.

> When a `compact` density is set, whitespace is set to `nowrap` by default to keep the rows as short in height as possible. This can be overridden in the `muiTableBodyCellProps` styles or sx prop.

### Disable or Hide the Density Toggle

In this example, the density toggle is disabled and a `compact` density is set by default in the `initialState` prop.
