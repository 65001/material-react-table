## Customizing Icons Feature Guide

Material React Table uses [Material Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons) by default for all of its internal icons.

If you need to, you can customize and replace some or all of the icons with your own custom icons. You can either use other Material Icons, or icons from a completely different library.

### Replace an Icon

To replace a default icon, you specify the icon in the `icons` prop. You should get TS hints for the name of the icons you can replace, but you can also consult [this source file](https://github.com/KevinVandy/material-react-table/blob/main/src/icons.ts) for a list of all the icons you can replace.

```tsx
<MaterialTable
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  icons={{
    SearchIcon: () => <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faSearch} />,
    SortIcon: (props) => (<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowDownWideShort} {...props} />), //best practice
  }}
```

> Some Icons have `style` props that get applied to them internally. So in order to preserve the ability of those Icons to be styled with the correct paddings, margins, or rotations, you should pass in `{...props}` to your custom Icon component as a best practice.

### Font Awesome Example

Here is an example where we use icons from a completely different library, [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
