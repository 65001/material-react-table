## Localization (i18n) Guide

> **Are you interested in contributing some official translations that can be included in MRT by default?** <br /><br />Please contact us on [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinVandy/material-react-table) or the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5wqyRx6fnm) to get in touch. We want to include dozens of languages and locales that can simply be imported from 'material-react-table'!

### Relevant Props

<RootPropTable onlyProps={new Set(['localization'])} />

---

Material React Table has full support for localization.

Some of the translations, such as the pagination component, will automatically respond to the locale of the MUI theme, so you just need to set that up correctly in your `ThemeProvider`.

Most of the other translations can be specified manually in the `localization` prop.

### Spanish Translation Example

Here's a crude not-so-accurately translated Spanish example:

_If you are willing and able to contribute accurate translations, please consider making a PR and they will be included as an extra import in this library_
