## Usage

### Setup

In order to start using MaterialReactTable, you need to first [install](/docs/install) `material-react-table` and the necessary Material UI v5 dependencies.

There are additional steps and customizations you can do for Material UI, if you have not set it up in your application already. Check out the [Material UI docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) for more information.

### Import MaterialReactTable

Once you have everything installed, you can import from `material-react-table` like this:

```tsx
import MaterialReactTable from 'material-react-table';
```

You may also want to import some TypeScript types from 'material-react-table'.

The `MRT_ColumnDef` type is especially useful for defining your columns in a type-safe way.

```tsx
import MaterialReactTable, { ColumnDefType } from 'material-react-table';
```

### Creating Data/Rows

Your data is an array of objects that have properties matching the accessors in your column definitions. It works best if your data is already in a flat object format like below, but it is not required.

```tsx
const data = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      name: 'John', // key "name" matches `accessorKey` in ColumnDef down below
      age: 30, // key "age" matches `accessorKey` in ColumnDef down below
    },
    {
      name: 'Sara',
      age: 25,
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

Your data does NOT have to be created statically like this, of course. More than likely, your data is being fetched from a backend API. Check out the [Remote Data example](/docs/examples/remote) to see how you can use a remote data source.

### Creating Columns

There are a lot of different ways to define columns, depending on your needs. Let's create some basic "data" columns. That is, columns that connect to our data. Since we defined our data in a flat object format, we can simply use the `accessorKey` property to access the data.

```tsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      header: 'Name',
      accessorKey: 'name',
    },
    {
      header: 'Age',
      accessorKey: 'age',
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

However, if you have a more nested data structure for your data, that's fine, but you will just need to use more complicated accessors when you define your columns. You will learn more about that [here](/docs/guides/data-columns#method-2---using-an-accessorfn-and-id).

### Simple Example

Throw it all together and you have a basic table! You can also play around and enable some features, either per column in the column definitions, or as props passed to `<MaterialReactTable />`.

```tsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';
import MaterialReactTable from 'material-react-table';

export default function App() {
  const columns = useMemo(
    () => [
      {
        accessorKey: 'name', //simple recommended way to define a column
        header: 'Name',
        muiTableHeadCellProps: { sx: { color: 'green' } }, //custom props
      },
      {
        accessorFn: (row) => row.age, //alternate way
        id: 'age', //id required if you use accessorFn instead of accessorKey
        header: 'Age',
        Header: <i style={{ color: 'red' }}>Age</i>, //optional custom markup
      },
    ],
    [],
  );

  const data = useMemo(
    () => [
      {
        name: 'John',
        age: 30,
      },
      {
        name: 'Sara',
        age: 25,
      },
    ],
    [],
  );

  return (
    <MaterialReactTable
      columns={columns}
      data={data}
      enableRowSelection //enable some features
      enableColumnOrdering
      enableGlobalFilter={false} //turn off a feature
    />
  );
}
```

> **Note:** It is very important that the columns and data definitions are _memoized_ or _stable_. Otherwise, the entire table will be re-rendered during every react re-render in your application, which can lead to performance issues. To make a variable stable, store in useState, or wrap in useMemo, or define outside of a component so it does not get recreated on every render.

This is just the default table that you get. You may want to disable some features that you don't need, or enable and customize other features that you may want. See the [minimal example](/docs/examples/minimal) and [advanced example](/docs/examples/advanced) to get a better idea for how you may want to customize your table, and visit the [props page](/docs/api/props) to see all the props that you can use to turn features on and off, and customize the look and feel of your table.
