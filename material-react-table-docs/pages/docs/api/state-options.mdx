## State Options

> Many of the state options that you can pass here are the same as the ones that you can pass to the [useReactTable](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/api/core/table) useTableInstance hook.

Here is a list of all the state options that you can pass to `initialState` or `state`.

```jsx
<MaterialReactTable
  initialState={
    {
      // all the state options you can pass here
    }
  }
  state={
    {
      // or here
    }
  }
/>
```

<StateOptionsTable />
