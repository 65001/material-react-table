## Props

> Many of the props that you can pass to `<MaterialReactTable />` are the same as the ones that you can pass to the TanStack Table [useReactTable](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/api/core/table) hook.

Here is a list of all the props that you can pass to the root `<MaterialReactTable />`.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable
//all the props you can pass here
/>
```

<RootPropTable />

<SourceCode />
