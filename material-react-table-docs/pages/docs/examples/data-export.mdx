## Data Export Example

Material React Table does not having data exporting built in. However, it is really easy to integrate your own exporting feature.

In this example, `export-to-csv` is connected to some export buttons in the top toolbar. If you need Excel exports or PDF exports, there is a plethora of NPM packages that can be used instead, but the idea remains the same.
