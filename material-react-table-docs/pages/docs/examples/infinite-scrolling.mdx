## Infinite Scrolling Example

An infinite scrolling table that is a table fetches data from a remote server as the user scrolls down the table. This works great with large datasets, just like our [Virtualized Example](/docs/examples/virtualized), except here we don't fetch all of the data at once upfront. Instead, we just fetch data a little bit at a time, as it becomes necessary.

Using a library like [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) makes it easy to implement an infinite scrolling table in Material React Table with the `useInfiniteQuery` hook.

Enabling the virtualization features here are actually optional, but encouraged if the table will be expected to render more than 100 rows at a time.
