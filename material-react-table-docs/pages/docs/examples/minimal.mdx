## Minimal Example

Material React Table gives you a lot out of the box, but it's also easy to turn off any features that you don't need.

Every feature has an `enable...` prop that let's you turn it on or off.

Don't want sorting? You can turn it off! Don't want either the top or bottom toolbars? You can hide them!
