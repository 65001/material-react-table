## Virtualized Example

Material React Table has a built-in row virtualization feature [(via `@tanstack/react-virual`)](https://tanstack.com/virtual/v3) that allows you to render a large number of rows without major performance issues.

Try out the performance of the table below with **10,000 rows**! Filtering, Search, and Sorting also maintain usable performance.

Also be sure to check out the full [row virtualization feature guide docs](/docs/guides/row-virtualization).
