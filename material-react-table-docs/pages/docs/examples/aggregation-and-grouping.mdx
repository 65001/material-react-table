## Aggregation and Grouping Example

Grouping and Aggregation features are usually hard to implement, but MRT (thanks to [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/api/features/grouping)) makes it easy.

You can group by a single or multiple columns at a time. Then, you can run aggregations on grouped columns to calculate totals, averages, max, min, etc.

The Grouping and Aggregation features work hand in hand with the Expanding and Sorting features. Try out grouping by various columns in the example below, and sorting by the aggregated columns, such as "age" or "salary".
